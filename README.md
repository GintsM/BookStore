## Bookstore
This project is made by given requirements. Options for the given API are only to add books and choose a category for books. So poor interaction because no more options to store other values. The greatest challenge is to retrieve Id from API, which was constructed by genius :), to do it I used JS Object.entries could see in src/redux/books/books.js. To work with API used middleware - npm package react-thunk. and to follow state logger (can see in browser console).
